         <h4 class="h5">How to use / consider the information provided through this tool:</h4>

         <h5 class="h6">Underlying presumptions:</h5>
         <p>This tool is meant to help a person/institution/government to manage his bitcoin holdings and to employ
            sustainable BTC withdrawal methods.</p>
         <p>This is not considered as a BTC trading tool, even though it presumes abilities to withdraw higher levels
            of BTC withdrawal based on BTC’s spot price (including authorizations to withdraw more than one bitcoin
            in
            advance, as long as the BTC spot price is over certain price thresholds.</p>

         <h5 class="h6">How the calculator works:</h5>
         <p><em class="fw-semibold">My BTC Stash size:</em> Of course, this inputted data could be the total of your
            BTC stash or it could be a part
            of your BTC stash that is set into such a separate budget. This also could be part or all of a budget of
            an institution, government or some
            organization that might be authorized to spend
            within such limits. I had personally been considering it as a way to set aside funds to fund developers.
            So,
            for example, a starting amount might
            be 21 BTC for a developer fund and 21 BTC in order to pay for expenses to administer such fund.</p>

         <p><em class="fw-semibold">Annual Withdrawal rate:</em> Of course, for the authorized monthly withdrawal,
            this inputted rate ends up getting
            divided by 12, but at the same time, since
            we are using the 200-week moving average (which mostly tends to be a bottom price) to valuate the size of
            our BTC stash, a sustainable withdrawal rate
            ends up higher than traditional assets that tend to recommend withdrawal rates of 4% or less.
            Accordingly:</p>
         <p>
         <ol class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item border-0">A. 0% to 5%: considered as growth-oriented withdrawal rates, and
               your BTC holdings (budget) will likely
               continue to grow in value if you use such withdrawal rates</li>
            <li class="list-group-item border-0">B. 6 to 10% presumptively sustainable withdrawal rates, and each
               person using such tool would need to decide
               for himself how conservative or
               aggressive to be regarding the employment of such withdrawal rates</li>
            <li class="list-group-item border-0">C. 11% to 16% - not as likely to be sustainable</li>
            <li class="list-group-item border-0">D. 17% and higher – likely to deplete the fund, and of course, lower
               rates are likely to sustain the fund
               longer than higher rates</li>
         </ol>
         </p>
         <p><em class="fw-semibold"> (Authorized) Month Withdrawal limit (BTC):</em> This output is calculated based
            on BTC stash size * Annual withdrawal / 12. When the BTC spot price is at least 25% above the 200-week
            moving average, then at least
            1 month’s withdrawal will be authorized; however,</p>
         <ol class="list-group">

            <li class="list-group-item border-0">F. if the BTC spot price is greater than 35% below the 200-week
               moving average, then you will be not be
               authorized to withdraw any BTC from the budget.</li>
         </ol>

         <p><em class="fw-semibold">(Authorized) Month Withdrawal limit (USD):</em> This output is calculated
            based on BTC stash size * Annual withdrawal / 12 (* USD Spot price).
            Since the BTC spot price is continuing to change, if the monthly withdrawal is not accomplished all at
            one time, it is best to refer to the BTC
            authorized monthly withdrawal amount to stay within limits.</p>

         <p> <em class="fw-semibold">Advanced Withdrawal (No. Months):</em> This output is calculated based on if
